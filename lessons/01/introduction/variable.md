## Variables

***

- In Python, and when programming in general, we need to build systems for dealing with data that changes over time.

- Python uses variables to define things that are subject to change.

    ```python
        greeting_message = "Welcome to Python!"
        score = 5
    ```

- In the above example, we defined a variable called `greeting_message` and set it equal to the `string`(_Welcome to Python!_). It also defined a variable called `score` and set it equal to the `number`(_5_).
