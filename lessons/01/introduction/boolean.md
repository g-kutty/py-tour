## Booleans

***

- Sometimes we have a need for variables that are either `true` or `false`. This datatype, which can only ever take one of two values, is called a __boolean__.

- In Python, we define booleans using the keywords `True` and `False`:

    ```python
        a = True
        b = False
    ```

- A boolean is actually a special case of an integer. A value of `True` corresponds to an integer value of `1`, and will behave the same. A value of `False` corresponds to an integer value of `0`.
