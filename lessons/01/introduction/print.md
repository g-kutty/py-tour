## Print statement
***

- Now what we're going to do is teach our computer to communicate. The gift of speech is valuable:

- A computer can answer many questions we have about "how" or "why" or "what" it is doing.

- In Python, the `print()` function is used to tell a computer to talk. The message to be printed should be surrounded by quotes:

    ```python
        # from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
        print("There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand.")
    ```

- In the above example, we direct our program to `print()` an excerpt from a notable book.

- The printed words that appear as a result of the `print()` function are referred to as output.

- The output of this example program would be:

    ```python
        There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand.
    ```
