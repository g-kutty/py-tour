- Most of the time, code should be written in such a way that it is easy to understand on its own.

- However, if you want to include a piece of information to explain a part of your code, you can use the `#` sign. A line of text preceded by a `#` is called a comment.

- The machine does not run this code â€” it is only for humans to read.

    ```Python
        # This variable counts how many rows of the spreadsheet we have:
        row_count = 13
    ```
