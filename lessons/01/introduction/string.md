## Strings

***

- Text in Python is considered a specific type of data called a string.

- A string, so named because they're a series of letters, numbers, or symbols connected in order.

- Strings can be defined in different ways:

    ```python
        print "This is a good string"
        print 'You can use single quotes or double quotes for a string'
    ```

- Both double-quotes `(")` and single-quotes `(')` are both acceptable ways to define a string, a string needs to be opened and closed by the same type of quote mark.

- We can combine multiple strings using `+`, like so:

    ```python
        print "This is " + "a good string"
    ```
