## Arithmetic

***

- One thing computers are capable of doing exceptionally well is performing `arithmetic`. __Addition__, __subtraction__, __multiplication__, __division__, and other numeric calculations are easy to do in most programming languages, and Python is no exception.

- Python also offers a companion to division called the __modulo__ operator. The modulo operator is indicated by `%` and returns the remainder after division is performed.

- Some examples:

    ```python
        add = 12381 + 91817
        sub = 981 - 312
        mul = 38 * 902
        div = 540 / 45
        mod = 15 % 2
    ```
