## Numbers

***

- Variables can also hold numeric values. The simplest kind of number in Python is the `integer`, which is a whole number with no decimal point:

    ```python
        int1 = 1
        int2 = 10
        int3 = -5
    ```

- A number with a decimal point is called a `float`.

    ```python
        float1 = 1.0
        float2 = 10.
        float3 = -5.5
    ```

- You can also define a float using scientific notation, with `e` indicating the power of 10:

    ```python
        # This evaluates to 150(1.5*10^2):
        float4 = 1.5e2
    ```
