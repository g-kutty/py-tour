- ### [Comments](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/comment)

    The way of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.

- ### [Print Statement](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/print)

    The print statement is used to send output to the standard output unit ( usually your monitor, or sometimes your printer ) of your computer system.

- ### [Strings](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/string)

    Text in Python is considered a specific type of data called a string, A string, so named because they're a series of letters, numbers, or symbols connected in order.

- ### [Variables](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/variable)

    In Python, and when programming in general, we need to build systems for dealing with data that changes over time. Python uses variables to define things that are subject to change.

- ### [Errors](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/error)

    These are complaints that Python makes when it doesn't understand what you want it to do.

- ### [Calculations](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/calculations)

    One thing computers are capable of doing exceptionally well is performing arithmetic. _Addition_, _subtraction_, _multiplication_, _division_, and other numeric calculations are easy to do in most programming languages, and Python is no exception.

- ### [Relational Operators](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/relational_operators)

    These _operators_ compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called __Relational operators__.

- ### [Logical Operators](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/logical_operators)

    The concept of logical operators is simple. They allow a program to make a decision based on multiple conditions. Each operand is considered a condition that can be evaluated to a _True_ or _False_ value.
