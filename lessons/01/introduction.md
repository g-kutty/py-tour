## Introduction
***

- ### [Comments](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/comments)

    The way of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.

- ### [Print Statement](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/print_statement)

    The print statement is used to send output to the standard output unit ( usually your monitor, or sometimes your printer ) of your computer system.

- ### [Strings](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/strings)

    Text in Python is considered a specific type of data called a string, A string, so named because they're a series of letters, numbers, or symbols connected in order.

- ### [Variables](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/variables)

    In Python, and when programming in general, we need to build systems for dealing with data that changes over time. Python uses variables to define things that are subject to change.

- ### [Errors](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/errors)

    These are complaints that Python makes when it doesn't understand what you want it to do.

- ### [Calculations](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/calculations)

    One thing computers are capable of doing exceptionally well is performing arithmetic. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and other numeric calculations are easy to do in most programming languages, and Python is no exception.

- ### [Relational Operators](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/relational_operators)

    These `operators` compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called Relational operators.

- ### [Logical Operators](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/logical_operators)

    The concept of logical operators is simple. They allow a program to make a decision based on multiple conditions. Each operand is considered a condition that can be evaluated to a `True` or `False` value.

- ### [Bitwise Operations](https://george-kj.github.io/py-tour/lessons/01/introduction/bitwise_operations)

    Bitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate bits. In all computers, numbers are represented with bits, a series of zeros and ones. In fact, pretty much everything in a computer is represented by bits.
