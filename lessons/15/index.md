title: 06 - Lists and Dictionaries

***

## [List](https://g-kutty.github.io/py-tour/lessons/06/list)
***

A __list__ is a `data structure` in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item.

## [Dictionary](https://g-kutty.github.io/py-tour/lessons/06/dictionary)
***

A __dictionary__ in Python is a collection of unordered values accessed by key rather than by index. The keys have to be hashable: integers, floating point numbers, strings, tuples, and frozensets are hashable, while lists, dictionaries, and sets other than [frozensets](https://g-kutty.github.io/py-tour/lessons/06/frozen_set) are not.
